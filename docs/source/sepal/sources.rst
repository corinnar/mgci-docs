============

The SEPAL-SDG 15.4.2 :sub:`beta` tool draws on a number of global data sources to allow the computation of the SDG 15.4.2 Indicator when similar national data is not available. 

The datasets described below have been made available by the following organizations under separate terms as indicated in their respective metadata:

- **Land cover**: European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) land cover maps, available on the `ESA-CCI land cover website <https://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/CCI/viewer/index.php>`_;
- **Digital Elevation Model**: The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), available at `Google Earth Engine Data SRTM <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/CGIAR_SRTM90_V4>`_; and
- **Administrative Boundaries**: FAO GAUL: Global Administrative Unit Layers 2015, available at `Google Earth Engine Data FAO GAUL <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/FAO_GAUL_2015_level1>`_.

**Note:** The **Administrative Boundaries** provided in this tool are in the public domain. The designations employed and the presentation of material on this map do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the Secretariat of the United Nations concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. If using the SEPAL-SDG 15.4.2 :sub:`beta` tool for official purposes, it is recommended that users use an official boundary provided by the designated office of their country.
